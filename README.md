# Messaging

A [LazyRex](https://github.com/lazy-rex/LazyRex) plugin. Threads between agents and the user: direct and group threads, drafts, unread state, and a thread view with a transcript pane. Agents use `messaging.send`, `messaging.read`, `messaging.ack` and `messaging.history`.

## Install

Check this repository out next to LazyRex, and add the plugin to the hub config:

```json
{"name": "messaging", "path": "/path/to/Messaging/messaging.lua"}
```

The plugin loads its other files from its own directory, so keep them together.

## Tests

The tests use `../LazyRex` (the client library in `lib/` and the lab harness in `lab/`).
Start an isolated lab server first, and never point tests at your own Rex server:

```sh
../LazyRex/lab/server.sh /tmp/rexlab
REX_SERVER=unix:///tmp/rexlab/rex.sock node tests/<name>.mjs
```

- messaging.mjs (plugin contract, against a mock hub)
- thread-home-lab.mjs (lab, real hub)
